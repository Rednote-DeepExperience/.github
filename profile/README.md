# Welcome to Rednote DeepExperience Lab

## Introduction
The Rednote DeepExperience Lab is dedicated to a dual mission: crafting exceptional AI-powered product experiences and pioneering self-evolving AI systems. For us, "experience" is both the end goal and the essential fuel. We aim to create intuitive products that users love, while designing AI that treats every interaction as a learning opportunity, accumulating "experience" to become more capable and intelligent over time.

## Research
- [DeepAgent](https://github.com/ExperienceAI-Lab/DeepAgent) is an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. This paradigm shifts away from traditional, predefined workflows (e.g., ReAct's "Reason-Act-Observe" cycle), allowing the agent to maintain a global perspective on the entire task and dynamically discover tools on an as-needed basis.
- [Video-Thinker](https://github.com/ExperienceAI-Lab/Video-Thinker) is an end-to-end video reasoning framework that empowers MLLMs to autonomously leverage intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities during inference. This paradigm extends "Thinking with Images" to video understanding, enabling dynamic temporal navigation and visual cue extraction without relying on external tools or pre-designed prompts. 
- [LoopTool](https://github.com/Rednote-DeepExperience-Lab/LoopTool) is a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes the data–training loop for robust LLM tool calls by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training through synergistic modules like *Capability Probing* and *Error-Driven Data Expansion*. This paradigm shifts away from traditional static synthetic data pipelines, enabling the adaptive diagnosis of model weaknesses and the progressive purification of the dataset to dramatically enhance tool-use capabilities.
